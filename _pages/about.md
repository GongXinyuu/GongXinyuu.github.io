I’m **Xinyu Gong**, a Machine Learning Engineer at **TikTok**. My research interests focus on **generative models** for **image/video synthesis**.

Before TikTok, I did my Ph.D. studies in **Electrical & Computer Engineering at UT Austin** (advised by Dr. Atlas Wang). I received my B.E. in Computer Science from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.
