I’m **Xinyu Gong**, a Machine Learning Engineer at **TikTok**. My research interests include **few-shot learning**, **neural architecture search**, and **generative models** for **image/video synthesis**.

Before TikTok, I did my Ph.D. studies in **Electrical & Computer Engineering at UT Austin** (advised by Dr. Atlas Wang), after starting my Ph.D. in **Computer Science at Texas A&M University** (also advised by Dr. Atlas Wang). I received my B.E. in Computer Science from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

You can find my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=A8e8UNAAAAAJ&hl=en) and download my CV via the link in the footer/social icons.
