      description:
        - Proposed and studied Multimodal Generalization (MMG), a novel and practical problem to investigate how a multimodal system can generalize when data from certain modalities is limited or missing.
        - Introduced MMG-Ego4D, a dataset to facilitate the study of MMG problem in ego-centric action recognition task, under both many-shot and few-shot settings. Built a strong baseline model to solve MMG problem, using contrastive learning and cross-modality alignment.

      description:
        - Delivered a few-shot generative adversarial network, which can learn new image classes with minimum computational cost incrementally. Designed a hypernetwork to enable the efficient new classes learning ability, improved model’s generalizability via weakening the discriminator and involving data augmentation.
